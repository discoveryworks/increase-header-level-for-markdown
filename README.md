# VSCode extension lower header level for Markdown

This VSCode extension is developed to lower the levels of all headers in the selected part of a Markdown file.

I used [Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) to build my personal website. However, I encountered difficulties when adding the Markdown file in the Courses section: the TOC in this section uses the second level headers of the Markdown file to construct its first level headings, and so on for other headers. To deal with this problem, I developed this VSCode extension.

## Features

- Lower the levels of all headers in the selected part of a Markdown file. 
  <!-- See an example below.
