# VSCode extension Markdown Lower Headers Level
This VSCode extension is developed to lower the level of all the titles of the selected part of a Markdown file.

I used [Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) to build my personal website. However, I encountered difficulties when adding the Markdown file in the Courses section: the TOC in this section uses the second level headers of the Markdown file to construct its first level headings, and so on for other headers. To deal with this problem, I developed this VSCode extension.
